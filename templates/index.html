            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>In recent years, we've seen how misinformation can have serious consequences, from influencing
                political campaigns to fueling public health crises. We believe that combatting fake news is an
                important way to promote responsible journalism and protect the public.</p>

            <h2>What it does</h2>
            <p>The fake news detector project uses Flask, a Python web framework, to build a web app that
                allows users to check whether a given news article is real or fake. The app takes in a news
                article input by the user and applies machine learning models to predict its authenticity. The
                models used are loaded from pre-trained files stored in the backend server and made using
                different models in a Python notebook file, where we explored the runtime and square error of
                different models on a Fake News dataset. The app presents the prediction results to the user,
                along with a probability score. Users can also provide feedback by clicking on buttons
                indicating whether the prediction was correct. The feedback data is stored in a CSV file on the
                server for future analysis. The app also features a dark mode option, enabled by a toggle
                switch.</p>

            <h2>How we built it</h2>
            <p>We built the fake news detector using Flask, a web application framework for Python, as the
                backend server. The server receives user input, which is the text of the news article and passes
                it through several machine-learning models to predict whether the news is real or fake. We
                used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to preprocess the text and extract its
                features. The models we used include Random Forest, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Tree
                Classifier, and Principal Component Analysis. We also used a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the
                text to numerical data that can be fed into the models.</p>
            <p>We also built a simple user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface allows
                users to enter the text of the news article, submit it to the backend server for prediction,
                and see the result. We also added a feedback system to allow users to indicate whether the
                prediction was correct or not. This feedback is stored in a CSV file that can be used to
                improve the performance of the machine learning models over time. Finally, we added a dark
                mode feature to the interface using JavaScript and CSS.</p>

            <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
            <p>During the development of our fake news classifier, we faced several challenges. One of the
                main challenges was the imbalance in the dataset, as we had more true news articles than fake
                ones. This could lead to bias in the model towards predicting most articles as true. To
                overcome this, we employed oversampling and undersampling techniques to balance the
                dataset.</p>
            <p>Another challenge we faced was the selection of the right set of features for the
                classifier. We experimented with different feature sets and finally decided to use the
                TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data to a numerical representation. However, fine-tuning
                the hyperparameters of the vectorizer was a time-consuming task, as it required several
                iterations to find the optimal values.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
            <p>We're proud to have successfully built and deployed a machine learning model to detect fake
                news with an accuracy of over 98% on our test dataset. Our team put in countless hours of
                research, experimentation, and collaboration to develop and fine-tune our model to achieve
                this high level of accuracy. We're also proud to have created a user-friendly interface for our
                model, which allows users to enter text and get a prediction on whether it's fake or real
                news.</p>
            <p>In addition, we're proud of the technical skills we developed throughout this project,
                including proficiency in data cleaning, natural language processing, and machine learning. We
                also honed our teamwork and communication skills, working together to overcome challenges and
                achieve our goals. Finally, we're proud to have contributed to the ongoing effort to combat the
                spread of misinformation, which has become a critical issue in today's society.</p>

            <h2>What we learned</h2>
            <p>Throughout this project, we learned how to build a machine learning model to classify news
                articles as real or fake. We used the Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithm and a
                TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction. We also learned how to preprocess text data by removing
                special characters and punctuation, lowercasing the text, and removing stopwords.</p>
            <p>In addition, we learned how to use the Kaggle API to download the dataset and how to mount
                Google Drive in Colab to access files stored in the cloud. We also learned how to use the
                pandas library to manipulate and combine datasets.</p>
            <p>We also learned how to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy
                and confusion matrix. We also learned how to save the trained model and the vectorizer to
                disk using the pickle library.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project provided us with valuable experience in working with text data and
                building a machine learning model to classify it. We gained insights into the preprocessing
                techniques, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation that are essential in
                building a successful machine learning model.</p>
